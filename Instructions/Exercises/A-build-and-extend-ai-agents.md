# Build and extend AI agents

An agent becomes genuinely useful when it can *do* things — look up live information,
call your business logic, and act on a user's behalf. In this exercise you'll build a
grounded agent and then give it capabilities using **tools**.

**Your scenario:** you work at **Adventure Works**, an outdoor-gear retailer that
also runs guided trips. Across this lab you'll build the assistant that helps customers
**plan a trip and choose the right gear for it**, adding one capability per task: first
grounding it in the store's own policies, then connecting it to live documentation, letting
it analyze sales data, take trip bookings, and check warehouse stock.

You'll start with the **Core** tasks that get you to a working, tool-using agent as
quickly as possible. From there, a set of **Optional** tasks lets you go deeper into the
areas that interest you most.

> **Note**: Some of the technologies used in this exercise are in preview or in active
> development. You may experience some unexpected behavior, warnings, or errors.

## What you'll learn

By completing the **Core** tasks of this exercise, you'll be able to:

- **Create and ground an agent** in the Microsoft Foundry portal so it answers from your
  own data rather than guessing.
- **Extend an agent with a tool** by connecting it to a remote **Model Context Protocol
  (MCP)** server, and handle tool-approval requests in code.

The **Optional** tasks let you additionally:

- Call your agent from a **client application**.
- Give an agent **custom function tools** that run your own Python logic.
- Build and connect your **own MCP server**.

## Lab at a glance

Complete the **Core** tasks first (about **35 minutes**) — they're self-contained and end
with a working, tool-using agent. Then expand any **Optional** tasks that interest you.
The full lab, including all optional tasks, takes about **1 hour 50 minutes**. Use the
buttons below to auto-expand a set of tasks that match the time you have.

| Section | Task | Difficulty | Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Core** | Task 1 – Create and ground an agent in the portal | ★☆☆ | ~15 min |
| **Core** | Task 2 – Connect the agent to a remote MCP server in code | ★★☆ | ~20 min |
| *Optional* | Task 3 – Call your agent from a client app | ★★☆ | ~20 min |
| *Optional* | Task 4 – Add custom function tools | ★★☆ | ~25 min |
| *Optional* | Task 5 – Build your own MCP server + client | ★★★ | ~30 min |

<!-- Lab-length picker. Works on the rendered GitHub Pages site; on GitHub.com's raw
     markdown view the buttons are inert, but every task can still be expanded manually.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this exercise, ensure you have:

- An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with sufficient permissions and quota to provision Azure AI resources
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your local machine
- [Python 3.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or later installed
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your local machine
- Basic familiarity with Python

> \* Python 3.14 is available, but some dependencies are not yet compiled for that release. The lab has been successfully tested with Python 3.13.12.

## Set up your environment

> **Note**: These setup steps are common to every lab in this path. Once the shared
> *Getting started* page exists, this section will link to it instead of repeating it.

### Create a Microsoft Foundry project

Microsoft Foundry uses projects to organize models, resources, data, and other assets.

1. In a web browser, open the [Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com) at `https://ai.azure.com` and sign in using your Azure credentials. Close any tips or quick start panes, and if necessary use the **Foundry** logo at the top left to navigate to the home page.

    > **Important**: For this lab, you're using the **New** Foundry experience.

1. In the top banner, select **Start building**.

1. When prompted, create a **new** project and enter a valid name (for example, `agents-lab-project`).

1. Expand **Advanced options** and specify:
    - **Microsoft Foundry resource**: *A valid name for your Foundry resource*
    - **Region**: *Select one available near you*\*
    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*
    - **Resource group**: *Select or create a resource group*

    > \* Some Azure AI resources are constrained by regional model quotas. If you hit a quota limit later, you may need to create another resource in a different region.

1. Select **Create** and wait for your project to be created. When prompted, continue through the welcome dialog and select **Create agent**.

1. Set the **Agent name** to `adventure-works-agent` and create the agent. The playground opens with a deployed model already selected for you.

Keep this browser tab open — you'll use it in Task 1.

---

# Core

The next two tasks are the required core of this lab. Task 1 builds a grounded agent in
the portal; Task 2 extends an agent with a tool in code.

## Task 1 — Create and ground an agent (portal)

Grounding gives your agent trusted source material so it answers accurately instead of
guessing.

1. In the agent playground, set the **Instructions** to:

    ```prompt
    You are the Adventure Works assistant.
    You help customers plan guided trips and choose the right gear, and answer questions about products, orders, returns, rentals, and guided trips.

    Guidelines:
    - Always be friendly and helpful
    - Use the store policy documentation to answer questions accurately
    - When a customer describes a trip, help them choose suitable gear and the right rental tier for it
    - If you don't know the answer, admit it and suggest contacting the support team directly
    ```

1. Download the sample store policy document. Open a new browser tab and navigate to:

    ```
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-agents/main/Labfiles/A-build-and-extend-ai-agents/portal-agent/Store_Policy.txt
    ```

    Save the file to your local machine.

1. Back in the playground, in the **Tools** section, select **Add**, and add **File search**.

1. To the right of **Add**, select **Upload files**, browse to the `Store_Policy.txt` file you downloaded, and select **Attach**. Wait for the file to be indexed.

1. **Save** the agent.

### Test your grounded agent

1. In the chat pane, enter:

    ```
    What's your return policy for a tent?
    ```

    The agent should reference the store policy document in its answer.

1. Try a second question that combines the policy data with a gear recommendation:

    ```
    I'm planning a weekend trip in the Rockies — what gear should I rent for it?
    ```

> ✅ **Checkpoint**: Your agent answers store questions using the uploaded policy document.
> You've created and grounded an agent entirely in the portal.

## Task 2 — Extend an agent with a remote MCP server (code)

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** lets an agent discover and call tools hosted by a
server. So far you've built the customer-facing advisor; now switch hats to the **Adventure
Works engineering team** that builds and runs it on Azure. In this task you'll
connect an agent to the **Microsoft Learn Docs** remote MCP server, giving that team an
assistant that can pull trusted, up-to-date Azure documentation on demand as they build the
trip-and-gear platform.

### Get the starter code

1. In VS Code, open the Command Palette (**Ctrl+Shift+P**), run **Git: Clone**, and enter:

    ```
    https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-agents.git
    ```

1. Open the cloned repo, then **File > Open Folder** and select `mslearn-ai-agents/Labfiles/A-build-and-extend-ai-agents/mcp`.

1. Expand the **Python** folder, right-click **requirements.txt**, and choose **Open in Integrated Terminal**. Then create a virtual environment and install packages:

    ```
    python -m venv labenv
    .\labenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Open the **.env** file and set `PROJECT_ENDPOINT` to your project endpoint and `MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` to your model deployment name. Save the file.

    > **Tip**: In the Foundry Toolkit VS Code extension, right-click your project deployment and select **Copy Project Endpoint** to get the endpoint URL.

### Connect the agent to the MCP server

Open **agent.py** and add code at each commented placeholder.

> **Tip**: As you add code, keep the indentation aligned with the comments.

1. **Add references**:

    ```python
    # Add references
    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
    from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
    from azure.ai.projects.models import PromptAgentDefinition, MCPTool
    from openai.types.responses.response_input_param import McpApprovalResponse, ResponseInputParam
    ```

1. **Connect to the agents client**:

    ```python
    # Connect to the agents client
    with (
        DefaultAzureCredential() as credential,
        AIProjectClient(endpoint=project_endpoint, credential=credential) as project_client,
        project_client.get_openai_client() as openai_client,
    ):
    ```

1. **Initialize agent MCP tool** — this points the agent at the Microsoft Learn Docs MCP server:

    ```python
    # Initialize agent MCP tool
    mcp_tool = MCPTool(
        server_label="api-specs",
        server_url="https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp",
        require_approval="always",
    )
    ```

1. **Create a new agent with the MCP tool**:

    ```python
    # Create a new agent with the MCP tool
    agent = project_client.agents.create_version(
        agent_name="platform-docs-agent",
        definition=PromptAgentDefinition(
            model=model_deployment,
            instructions="You are a platform engineering assistant for Adventure Works. Use the available MCP tools to look up trusted Azure documentation and help the team build and operate the trip-and-gear platform.",
            tools=[mcp_tool],
        ),
    )
    print(f"Agent created (id: {agent.id}, name: {agent.name}, version: {agent.version})")
    ```

1. **Create a conversation thread**:

    ```python
    # Create a conversation thread
    conversation = openai_client.conversations.create()
    print(f"Created conversation (id: {conversation.id})")
    ```

1. **Send initial request that will trigger the MCP tool**:

    ```python
    # Send initial request that will trigger the MCP tool
    response = openai_client.responses.create(
        conversation=conversation.id,
        input="Give me the Azure CLI commands to deploy our product catalog API to an Azure Container App with a managed identity.",
        extra_body={"agent_reference": {"name": agent.name, "type": "agent_reference"}},
    )
    ```

1. **Process any MCP approval requests** — because the tool requires approval, the agent
    pauses and asks permission before each call. This loop auto-approves each request:

    ```python
    # Process any MCP approval requests that were generated
    while True:
        input_list: ResponseInputParam = []
        for item in response.output:
            if item.type == "mcp_approval_request":
                if item.server_label == "api-specs" and item.id:
                    input_list.append(
                        McpApprovalResponse(
                            type="mcp_approval_response",
                            approve=True,
                            approval_request_id=item.id,
                        )
                    )

        # No more approvals needed -> the agent has produced its final response
        if not input_list:
            break

        response = openai_client.responses.create(
            input=input_list,
            previous_response_id=response.id,
            extra_body={"agent_reference": {"name": agent.name, "type": "agent_reference"}},
        )

    print(f"\nAgent response: {response.output_text}")
    ```

1. **Clean up the agent version** so you don't leave test agents behind:

    ```python
    # Clean up resources by deleting the agent version
    project_client.agents.delete_version(agent_name=agent.name, agent_version=agent.version)
    print("Agent deleted")
    ```

1. Save the file (**Ctrl+S**).

### Run and test

1. In the terminal, sign in and run the app:

    ```
    az login
    ```

    ```
    python agent.py
    ```

1. Watch the agent create itself, call the MCP tool (approved automatically by your loop), and answer using live documentation. You should see output similar to:

    ```
    Agent created (id: platform-docs-agent:2, name: platform-docs-agent, version: 2)
    Created conversation (id: conv_...)

    Agent response: Here are Azure CLI commands to create an Azure Container App with a managed identity:
    ...
    Agent deleted
    ```

1. Try changing the `input` string to ask about a different Azure service, and run again.

> ✅ **Checkpoint**: You've built a grounded agent *and* extended an agent with an

When you're finished, enter `deactivate` to exit the virtual environment.

# Optional

These tasks are independent — expand any that interest you, in any order. Each begins with
a **Try it first** prompt; expand **Show a solution** when you want the full walkthrough.

> just write a `respond()` function and hand it to `run_chat_app()`.

<details markdown="1" class="opt-task" data-tier="2">
<summary><strong>Task 3 — Call your agent from a client app</strong> &middot; ★★☆ &middot; ~20 min</summary>

**Goal**: Interact with the grounded portal agent from a small **web chat app** instead of
the playground — including charts the agent produces (from code interpreter), which render
**inline** in the chat window.

**Concept reinforced**: consuming an agent programmatically with the Foundry SDK — loading
an existing agent by name and driving it with the Responses API. A provided UI shell
(`adventure_ui.py`) turns your agent into a browser chat app, so you focus on the agent code,
not the interface.

**Set up:**

1. In the portal, open your `adventure-works-agent`, add a **Code interpreter** tool, and upload
    a data file so there's something to analyze. Download and attach:

    ```
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-agents/main/Labfiles/A-build-and-extend-ai-agents/portal-agent/weekly_sales.csv
    ```

    Save the agent.

1. In VS Code, open the `Labfiles/A-build-and-extend-ai-agents/portal-agent/Python` folder.
    Create a virtual environment, install requirements, then open **.env** and set
    `PROJECT_ENDPOINT` and `AGENT_NAME` (`adventure-works-agent`):

    ```
    python -m venv labenv
    .\labenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

> **Try it first**: The `agent_with_functions.py` file already contains a complete client
> that launches a web chat window. Before running it, predict: which SDK call loads your
> existing portal agent *by name*? How does the client tell the Responses API to use that
> agent? How does a `respond()` function turn one message into a reply the UI can show?

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Show a solution</summary>

The provided `agent_with_functions.py` already implements the client and hands its
`respond()` function to the shared `run_chat_app()` shell. The lines that matter are:

1. **Load your portal agent by name** (using `AGENT_NAME` from **.env**):

    ```python
    agent = project_client.agents.get(agent_name=agent_name)
    ```

2. **Route each request to that agent** through the Responses API (inside `respond()`):

    ```python
    response = openai_client.responses.create(
        conversation=conversation.id,
        extra_body={"agent_reference": {"name": agent.name, "type": "agent_reference"}},
        input="",
    )
    ```

3. **Inline charts**: helper functions detect image outputs and `container_file_citation`
    annotations, save them under `agent_outputs/`, and return them in an `AgentReply` so the
    UI renders them **inline** in the chat.

4. **Launch the app**: the file ends by starting the browser chat window:

    ```python
    run_chat_app(respond, title="Adventure Works Assistant")
    ```

Sign in and run it:

```
az login
python agent_with_functions.py
```

Your browser opens a chat window at `http://localhost:7860`. Ask for something that uses
code interpreter:

```
Analyze the weekly sales data and create a chart of revenue over time.
```

The agent's analysis appears in the chat and the **chart is shown inline**. Close the
browser tab and press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal to stop the app.

</details>

**Stretch**: display the agent's token usage after each response.

</details>

<details markdown="1" class="opt-task" data-tier="2">
<summary><strong>Task 4 — Add custom function tools</strong> &middot; ★★☆ &middot; ~25 min</summary>

**Goal**: Give an agent tools backed by your **own Python functions**, and process the
function calls it makes.

**Concept reinforced**: the function-calling loop — the agent decides *which* tool to
call and with *what* arguments; your code executes it and returns the result.

**Set up:**

1. Open the `Labfiles/A-build-and-extend-ai-agents/custom-functions/Python` folder, create
    a virtual environment, install requirements, and set `PROJECT_ENDPOINT` and
    `MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` in **.env**. Review **functions.py**, which contains the trip
    planner's helper functions.

> **Try it first**: Look at `next_available_trip(region)` in **functions.py**. How would
> you describe its single `region` parameter to the model so it knows when and how to
> call it? Write the JSON schema before revealing the solution.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Show a solution</summary>

Work through the comments in **agent.py**. Add references and connect to the project (the
same pattern as Task 2). The file is structured so your agent setup runs once, then a
`respond()` function handles each chat message and hands the reply to `run_chat_app()`:

1. **Define the three function tools.** Each schema tells the model how to call one of the
    Python functions — for example the trip lookup tool:

    ```python
    # Define the trip lookup function tool
    trip_tool = FunctionTool(
        name="next_available_trip",
        description="Get the next available guided trip in a given region.",
        parameters={
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "region": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "region to find the next guided trip in (e.g. 'pacific_northwest', 'rockies', 'patagonia')",
                },
            },
            "required": ["region"],
            "additionalProperties": False,
        },
        strict=True,
    )
    ```

    Define `cost_tool` (`calculate_rental_cost`) and `report_tool`
    (`generate_booking_report`) the same way, matching each function's parameters.

2. **Create the agent with all three tools:**

    ```python
    agent = project_client.agents.create_version(
        agent_name="trip-planner-agent",
        definition=PromptAgentDefinition(
            model=model_deployment,
            instructions="""You are a trip planning assistant for Adventure Works that helps
                customers find guided trips and calculate gear rental costs.
                Use the available tools to assist users with their inquiries.""",
            tools=[trip_tool, cost_tool, report_tool],
        ),
    )
    ```

3. **Fill in the tool-calling loop** inside `respond()` — read each `function_call` from the
    response, run the matching Python function, and collect a `FunctionCallOutput`:

    ```python
    # Process function calls
    for item in response.output:
        if item.type == "function_call":
            result = None
            if item.name == "next_available_trip":
                result = next_available_trip(**json.loads(item.arguments))
            elif item.name == "calculate_rental_cost":
                result = calculate_rental_cost(**json.loads(item.arguments))
            elif item.name == "generate_booking_report":
                result = generate_booking_report(**json.loads(item.arguments))
            input_list.append(
                FunctionCallOutput(
                    type="function_call_output",
                    call_id=item.call_id,
                    output=result,
                )
            )
    ```

    The rest of `respond()` (already provided) sends the outputs back and returns the final
    answer to the chat window:

    ```python
    # Send function call outputs back to the model and retrieve a response
    if input_list:
        response = openai_client.responses.create(
            input=input_list,
            previous_response_id=response.id,
            extra_body={"agent_reference": {"name": agent.name, "type": "agent_reference"}},
        )

    return AgentReply(text=response.output_text)
    ```

Run `python agent.py`. Your browser opens the chat window — try a prompt that needs **two**
tools at once:

```
Find me the next trip I can join in Patagonia and give me the cost for 5 days of premium gear rental at priority service.
```

The agent calls both functions in one turn and combines the results, for example:

```
The next trip available in Patagonia is the Patagonia Glacier Trek on February 17th.
The cost for 5 days of premium gear rental at priority service is $1,875.
```

Close the browser tab and press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal to stop the app (the agent is
deleted automatically on exit).

</details>

<summary><strong>Task 5 — Build your own MCP server</strong> &middot; ★★★ &middot; ~30 min</summary>

**Goal**: Instead of connecting to someone else's MCP server, host your **own** tools and
connect an agent to them. Here you'll give Adventure Works a warehouse assistant
that reads live stock and sales figures.

**Concept reinforced**: the MCP server/client split — a server *registers* tools; a client
*discovers and calls* them on the agent's behalf.

**Set up:**

1. Open the `Labfiles/A-build-and-extend-ai-agents/mcp/Python` folder (you set up its
    virtual environment and **.env** in Task 2). You'll edit **server.py** and **client.py**.

> **Try it first**: Wire up **server.py** and **client.py** using the comments in each file.
> As you go, consider: why must diagnostic output go to `stderr` (or be suppressed) rather
> than `stdout`? *(Hint: MCP speaks JSON-RPC over stdio, so anything printed to stdout is
> parsed as protocol messages — a stray banner corrupts the stream. That's why the server
> starts with `show_banner=False`.)*

<summary>Show a solution</summary>

**In `server.py`** — create the server and expose the two provided functions as tools:

```python
# Add references
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Create an MCP server
mcp = FastMCP(name="Inventory")

@mcp.tool()
def get_inventory_levels() -> dict:
    ...  # returns the sample inventory dict already in the file

@mcp.tool()
def get_weekly_sales() -> dict:
    ...  # returns the sample sales dict already in the file

# Run the MCP server
mcp.run(show_banner=False)
```

**In `client.py`** — connect to the server, discover its tools, and register them with an
agent. Because the chat UI runs on an async event loop, the connection code lives in an
async `setup()` that runs once on the first message, and each message is handled by an async
`respond()`:

1. Inside `setup()`, start the server over stdio and open a session, then list the available
    tools:

    ```python
    stdio_transport = await exit_stack.enter_async_context(stdio_client(server_params))
    stdio, write = stdio_transport
    session = await exit_stack.enter_async_context(ClientSession(stdio, write))
    await session.initialize()
    tools = (await session.list_tools()).tools
    ```

2. Wrap each MCP tool as a callable and build `FunctionTool` definitions the agent can use:

    ```python
    def make_tool_func(tool_name):
        async def tool_func(**kwargs):
            return await session.call_tool(tool_name, kwargs)
        tool_func.__name__ = tool_name
        return tool_func

    functions_dict = {tool.name: make_tool_func(tool.name) for tool in tools}

    mcp_function_tools = [
        FunctionTool(
            name=tool.name,
            description=tool.description,
            parameters={"type": "object", "properties": {}, "additionalProperties": False},
            strict=True,
        )
        for tool in tools
    ]
    ```

3. Create the agent with those tools (in `setup()`), then in `respond()` run the tool-calling
    loop (same pattern as Task 4) — but invoke the wrapped **async** MCP function for each
    `function_call`, and return the answer to the chat window:

    ```python
    agent = project_client.agents.create_version(
        agent_name="inventory-agent",
        definition=PromptAgentDefinition(
            model=model_deployment,
            instructions="""
            You are an inventory assistant. Here are some general guidelines:
            - Recommend restock if item inventory < 10 and weekly sales > 15
            - Recommend clearance if item inventory > 20 and weekly sales < 5
            """,
            tools=mcp_function_tools,
        ),
    )

    for item in response.output:
        if item.type == "function_call":
            kwargs = json.loads(item.arguments)
            output = await functions_dict[item.name](**kwargs)
            input_list.append(
                FunctionCallOutput(
                    type="function_call_output",
                    call_id=item.call_id,
                    output=output.content[0].text,
                )
            )

    # ...send outputs back, then:
    return AgentReply(text=response.output_text)
    ```

Run `python client.py`. Your browser opens the chat window — the server is launched for you
over stdio on the first message. Try:

```
Show me the current inventory levels for all products.
```

The agent calls your custom tools and answers from the returned data. Because the
conversation is stateful, follow-ups like *"Are there any products that should be
restocked?"* work too. Close the browser tab and press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal to stop
the app.

**Stretch**: add a third tool (for example, `get_reorder_threshold`) and watch the agent
discover it without any other code changes.

## Summary

In this exercise you:

- Created and **grounded** an agent in the Foundry portal so it answers from your data.
- **Extended an agent with a tool** by connecting it to a remote MCP server and handling
  tool-approval requests in code.
- (Optionally) consumed an agent from a **client app**, added **custom function tools**,
  and built your **own MCP server**.

Together these show the two big levers for making agents useful: giving them the right
**knowledge** (grounding) and the right **capabilities** (tools).

## Clean up

If you're finished, delete the resources you created to avoid unnecessary Azure costs.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to the resource group that contains your Foundry resource.
1. On the toolbar, select **Delete resource group**, enter the resource group name, and confirm.

> The code you ran in Task 2 already deletes the agent version it creates. Portal
> agents are removed when you delete the resource group.
